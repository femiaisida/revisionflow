### AI that knows you
Every AI feature in RevisionFlow uses your full student profile — subjects, boards, tier, current and target grades, topic confidence ratings, past paper scores, mistake log, revision sessions, upcoming exams, and priority list. The AI doesn't give generic advice. It references your actual data.

### Verified exam database
Grade boundaries and paper structures are sourced from official published AQA, Edexcel and OCR results. 2026 exam dates are verified from confirmed timetables. The database covers 30+ GCSE subjects and 30+ A-Level subjects across all major boards.

### Revision schedule generator
A 7-step wizard that builds a personalised calendar around your exam dates, availability, and preferred session length. Exports to ICS (compatible with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook). Generates sessions with paper rotation and a 2:1 content-to-exam-practice ratio.
